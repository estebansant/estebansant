- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Esteban Santiago!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in physics, but I am currently learning how to code professional websites with React.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning code on Platzi, place where I have learned (so far) HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, alongside with other technologies like Git, Webpack, Babel, Vite and SCSS.
- ðŸ“« I will be posting projects about the things that I learn in classes through time, to see how much I learn and to test my skills. Also expect to see some personal projects like The Scientific Room and Achorded over here.

Thanks for your time!
