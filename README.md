- 👋 Hi, I’m Esteban Santiago!
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, but I am currently learning about coding and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding on Platzi. Now I am starting with the basics: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects and ideas to practice my programming skills.
- 📫 I will be posting projects about the things that I learn in classes through time, to see how much I learn and to test my skills.

Thanks for your time!
