- 👋 Hi, I’m Esteban Santiago!
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, but I am currently learning about coding and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning code on Platzi. I have mastered the basics(HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and now I am learning React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects and ideas to practice my programming skills.
- 📫 I will be posting projects about the things that I learn in classes through time, to see how much I learn and to test my skills. Also expect to see some personal projects like The Scientific Room over here.

Thanks for your time!
